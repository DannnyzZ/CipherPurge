## 📍 Overview

CipherPurge stands as a commanding solution for those seeking robust data protection mechanisms. Merging advanced data wiping, data zeroing, data over AES-256 encryption, data zeroing, and data overwriting capabilities, CipherPurge introduces a powerful and intuitive Tkinter GUI interface for effortless data security management.

**CipherPurge** was created with a singular, paramount purpose: to enhance data security and protect your sensitive information in an increasingly digital and interconnected world.

In today's landscape of ever-evolving cyber threats and data breaches, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of your digital assets is of utmost importance. Whether you're an individual seeking to safeguard personal documents or a business striving to protect proprietary information, CipherPurge offers a comprehensive solution. The software's sole purpose is to provide you with a powerful and accessible tool to:

> **Sanitize Data:** CipherPurge ensures that your data is thoroughly sanitized before encryption. By randomizing and zeroing out its contents, it guarantees that no trace of your original data remains.

> **Encrypt Securely:** Employing the AES-256 encryption standard, CipherPurge transforms your files into an unreadable format, adding an additional layer of security to your data.

> **Dispose Safely:** CipherPurge securely disposes of your encrypted files by moving them to the system and user trash. With the option to empty both trash locations, you can be certain that your sensitive files are beyond recovery.

CipherPurge incorporates the principles of **"Defense in Depth**," a cybersecurity strategy that emphasizes multiple layers of protection. This approach ensures that even if one layer is compromised, others remain intact to thwart potential threats. 

By offering military-grade encryption, data randomization, and secure file disposal in a user-friendly interface, CipherPurge empowers individuals and organizations to take control of their data security.

## ⚙️ Features

| Feature                                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **⚙️ Data Encryption with AES-256**       | CipherPurge implements AES-256 encryption to ensure robust data security. The Advanced Encryption Standard with a 256-bit key provides high-level data confidentiality. It uses the `cryptography` library to perform AES encryption in Cipher Feedback (CFB) mode.    |
| **🔐 Secure File Overwriting**            | Enhancing data protection, the program securely overwrites files using a two-step process: randomization and zeroing. Random data is generated to match the original file's size, and zeroing ensures complete data erasure, preventing data recovery attempts.        |
| **📝 Action Logging**                    | CipherPurge maintains a detailed action log that records timestamped entries. This audit trail provides a comprehensive history of operations, aiding in accountability and troubleshooting. The log file is created in a "Logs" folder within the program directory.      |
| **🔄 Multithreaded Processing**           | To maintain a responsive user interface during time-consuming tasks, the program employs multithreading. Background operations, such as emptying the trash, run in separate threads, ensuring a smooth user experience while efficiently executing tasks.           |
| **📂 File Selection and Management**      | Users can select multiple files through a file dialog, and the program efficiently manages these selections in a Python list. Selected files are displayed in a user-friendly list, including file names, sizes, and extensions for easy reference and management.    |
| **🎨 UI Customization**                   | CipherPurge offers interface customization options, allowing users to define background and button colors, as well as font styles. This customization enhances visual appeal and tailors the program's appearance to individual preferences.                  |
| **❗ Error Handling and Reporting**        | Robust error-handling mechanisms catch and report exceptions during file operations. User-friendly error messages provide clear guidance in case of unexpected issues, ensuring a seamless and user-friendly experience.                                       |
| **🖼️ Resizable User Interface**          | Users can resize the application window, adapting it to different screen resolutions and preferences. This feature enhances user comfort and usability, accommodating various display configurations and environments.                                        |
| **📁 File Format Versatility**           | Designed to accommodate diverse file formats, CipherPurge is versatile and suitable for processing various data types, including text, binary, documents, and images. This flexibility ensures compatibility with a wide range of file formats.                  |

## 🔑 Generating RSA Keys

1. Open the Command Prompt:
- Press the Windows key.
Type "cmd" or "Command Prompt" and press Enter.

> In the Command Prompt, use the ssh-keygen command to generate an RSA key pair. Specify the -t option to indicate the key type (RSA) and the -b option to set the desired key length (e.g., 4096 bits). You can also specify the output file using the -f option:

```sh
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f "C:\Users\Root\RSA_KEY"
```
Replace "Root" with your actual Windows username. This command will generate an RSA key pair with a 4096-bit key length and save it in your user's .ssh directory with the name "RSA_KEY"

You will be prompted to enter a passphrase for added security. You can choose to set a passphrase or leave it empty for no passphrase.

Once the key pair is generated, you will find two files in your user's .ssh directory:

id_rsa (the private key)
id_rsa.pub (the public key)


### ✔️ Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:

>  ` Windows 7/8/10/11`

>  ` Python`

>  ` Python Package Installer `

>  ` Python library: tkinter `

>  ` Python library: cryptography `

>  ` Python library: send2trash `

>  ` Internet connection `

### 💻 Installation

1. Install python
```sh
1.	Visit the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2.	Go to the Downloads section and choose the version of Python you want to install (e.g., Python 3.9.6).
3.	Scroll down to the bottom of the page and select the installer that matches your system architecture (32-bit or 64-bit).
4.	Run the downloaded installer.
5.	In the installer, select the option to add Python to the system PATH, which will make it accessible from the command line.
6.	Make sure that in optional features you choose pip to be installed.
7.	Complete the installation by following the on-screen instructions.
```

2. Install dependencies
```sh
pip install pip & pip install tkinter & pip install cryptography & pip install send2trash & pip install tk
```

3. Check version of python and pip:
```sh
python --version && pip --version
```

### 🎮 Using CipherPurge


1. Download cipherpurge.py from this link:
```sh
https://github.com/DannnyzZ/CipherPurge/blob/main/cipherpurge.py
```
2. Run commandline or powershell and execute:

```
WARNING! Make sure You provide the correct location of CipherPurge.

Example of use:
```sh
python C:\Users\Danny\Desktop\cipherpurge.py
```

### ⚠️ Warning


**Using CipherPurge safely:**

1. Data Irreversibility: Understand that CipherPurge permanently deletes and overwrites files. Once an operation is performed, it cannot be undone. Make sure you have backups or are absolutely certain about the files you select for processing.

2. Data Loss: CipherPurge sanitizes files by clearing their content, randomizing data, zeroing it out, encrypting it, and moving it to the trash. This may result in complete data loss. Do not use this tool on files you intend to keep.

3. Use with Caution: CipherPurge is designed for secure data destruction and not for general file management. Use it responsibly and only on files you explicitly intend to delete.

4. Backup Important Data: Before using CipherPurge, back up any important or valuable data to ensure it is not accidentally deleted or overwritten.

5. Contact Developer: If you have any doubts or need assistance, contact the developer for guidance.

**Use CipherPurge wisely to enhance data security while minimizing risks.**
